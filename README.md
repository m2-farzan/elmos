# Elmos-vahed Semster Planning Assistant

This web app has helped 10,000+ IUST students over the last 7 years plan their courses. Assuming it saves each student at least 30 mins per semster and each student uses it for planning 6 semsters, a lovely sum of 30,000 frustrating man-hours has been saved by it!

However, I have decided to retrie myself from it and release the code due to some annoying obstacles:
- Uni IPs are blocked from overseas so the servers from outside the country can't crawl
- Getting a domestic server requires ID verifications that are impossible without an Iranian sim

Please feel free to fork this and deploy it!
Read `DOCS.md` for a quick start and get in touch if you need help.
I'll advertise good alternatives over my original domain.

Best regards,<br>
